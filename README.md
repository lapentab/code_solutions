Solutions to short coding problems

This will contain a variety of unrelated python files of interesting coding challenges I have come across or found.
Information shared here will not offer any quiz or problem set solutions that would compromise academic integrity.
If they are questions from a coding practice problem, results will only be released here if any other solution is officially public.

Otherwise, they are just solutions to make my own life easier.
